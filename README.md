Data analysis on European Covid data from 2020 through 2022 using R. I conducted exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test, explored correlation and conducted autoregression. I looked at the rate of covid incidence and infection among all European countries and then focused in on France and Germany to identify trends in infection and incidence rates over time in the two countries. The images are depicted separately from the markdown file since I had difficulty uploading Markdown to GitHub.
